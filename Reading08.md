## Reading 8: Operators and Loops

#### Assignments Operators
- Assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand

#### Assigning to properties
- if an expression does not evaluate to an object, then assignments to properties of that expression do not assign 
- it is an error to assign values to unmodifiable properties or to properties of an expression without properties (null or undefined)

#### Destructing 
- For more complex assignment, the destructing assignment syntax is a javascript expression that makes it possible to extract data from arrays for objects using a syntax that mirrors the construction of arrays and objects literals

#### Comparsion Operates
- Compares it operands and return a logical value based on whether the comparsion is true
- Strings are compared based on standard lexicographical ordering, using unicode value

#### Loops
- A 'for' loop repeats until a specified condition evalutes to false
- A 'while' statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates true
